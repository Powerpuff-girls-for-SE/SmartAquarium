# Smart Aquarium Project - Software Engineering for Internet of Things
The IoT-Based Smart Aquarium System is an advanced solution designed to monitor and maintain optimal conditions within an aquarium. Utilizing a suite of sensors, this system will continuously monitor various environmental factors, such as temperature, pH levels, diffused oxygen, dissolved ammonia-nitrogen, and water level. The primary goal is to ensure a healthy habitat for aquatic life by providing real-time data monitoring and customised thresholds according to the species of fish present in the aquarium.
